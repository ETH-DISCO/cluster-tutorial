This guide will help you get started with using the TIK cluster at ETH Zurich.

# 1. SSH into the cluster

First enable your VPN connection to the ETH network.

- VPN documentation: https://www.isg.inf.ethz.ch/Main/ServicesNetworkVPN
- Based on my experience the openconnect CLI doesn't work. So i suggest downloading the the cisco anyconnect client and using the following settings:
	- server: `https://sslvpn.ethz.ch`
	- username: `<username>@student-net.ethz.ch`
	- password: your network password (also called Radius password, see: https://www.password.ethz.ch/)

Then ssh into the tik42 login node and use your default password (also called LDAPS/AD password).

```bash
ssh <username>@tik42x.ethz.ch
```

You can also configure a shortcut in your `~/.ssh/config` file to be able to ssh using just `ssh j2tik` or `ssh tik42x` in the future.

```
Host j2tik
  HostName j2tik.ethz.ch
  User <username>
Host tik42x
  HostName tik42x.ethz.ch
  User <username>
```

Once you're in you'll have access to:

- Compute: The login node is only for file management and job submission. do not run any computation on the login node. Run batch jobs on the compute nodes using the SLURM system. SLURM is a common job scheduler used in many HPC systems so mastering it is time well spent. You'll find plenty of resources online.
- Storage: Use `/itet-stor/<username>/net_scratch` to store your data.

Keep in mind:

- to use >8 GPUs you need your supervisor's permission and reserve the nodes in advance in the shared calendar.
- only submit jobs to `arton[01-08]`
	- see all available nodes using `sinfo`
	- the A100s with 80GB on `tikgpu10` need special privileges
	- the A6000s with 48GB on `tikgpu08` need special privileges
- set friendly `nice` values to your jobs and keep them short and efficient.

# 2. Setup

To set up your environment first install conda using the `conda_install.sh` script.

Optionally set up the "libmamba" solver for faster dependency resolution:

```bash
conda update -n base conda
conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
conda config --set solver libmamba
```

Next add the following instructions to your `~/.bashrc.<username>` file and then run `source ~/.bashrc.<username>`:

```bash
# convenience commands for slurm
export SLURM_CONF=/home/sladmitet/slurm/slurm.conf
alias smon_free="grep --color=always --extended-regexp 'free|$' /home/sladmitet/smon.txt"
alias smon_mine="grep --color=always --extended-regexp '${USER}|$' /home/sladmitet/smon.txt"
alias watch_smon_free="watch --interval 300 --no-title --differences --color \"grep --color=always --extended-regexp 'free|$' /home/sladmitet/smon.txt\""
alias watch_smon_mine="watch --interval 300 --no-title --differences --color \"grep --color=always --extended-regexp '${USER}|$' /home/sladmitet/smon.txt\""

# troubleshooting for common issues
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
echo 'export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LANG=en_US.UTF-8' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8' >> ~/.bashrc
```

# 2. Upload your code

The most straightforward way to upload your code is to use `scp`:

```bash
scp -r /path/to/your/code <username>@tik42x.ethz.ch:/itet-stor/<username>/net_scratch
```

Alternatively you can also clone your repository directly on the cluster.

# 3. Submit batch jobs

To submit a job to the cluster you can use the `sbatch` command. An example job script is provided in `job.sh` and you can submit it using `sbatch job.sh`.

Similarly if you have lots of jobs, you can use an array job to start them all and make sure that only x of them are running at the same time. An example job script is provided in `job_array.sh` and you can submit it using `sbatch job_array.sh`.

To debug the scripts locally, you can create the conda environment using `conda env create -f env.yml` activate it with `conda activate cluster-tutorial` and call `python job.py`.

# Debugging and Prototyping

Job scripts don't show the output in real time.

For debugging or prototyping purposes it might make sense to attach your terminal to individual compute nodes.

```bash
# check node availability
smon_free
squeue --Format=jobarrayid:9,state:10,partition:14,reasonlist:16,username:10,tres-alloc:47,timeused:11,command:140,nodelist:20

# attach to a tikgpu06 node assuming it's free
srun  --mem=25GB --gres=gpu:01 --nodelist tikgpu06 --pty bash -i
```

Next you can activate run a jupyter notebook on the compute node and access it through your browser using the following commands:

```bash
conda create --name jupyternb notebook --channel conda-forge
conda activate jupyternb
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 5998 --ip $(hostname -f) # port range [5900-5999]
```

The output will then show you at which link you can access the notebook.

Make sure to deactivate the conda environment after you're done debugging:

```bash
conda remove --yes --name jupyternb --all
conda env list
conda deactivate
exit # back to login node
```

# Fallback

If you're on a tight deadline and can't get the cluster to work, you can always fall back to using cloud GPUs.

Here are some pricing comparisons:

As of August 2024, Google Colab's free tier offers a Tesla T4 with 15GB of RAM (the highest tier you can get for free) and 12 hours of runtime:

```
__CUDNN VERSION: 8906
__Number CUDA Devices: 1
__CUDA Device Name: Tesla T4
__CUDA Device Total Memory [GB]: 15.835660288
```
