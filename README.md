This guide will help you get started with the TIK cluster at ETH Zurich.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. SSHing into the cluster

First, enable your VPN connection to the ETH network.

- VPN documentation: https://www.isg.inf.ethz.ch/Main/ServicesNetworkVPN
- Based on my experience the openconnect CLI doesn't work. So I suggest downloading the the Cisco-Anyconnect client and using the following settings:
	- server: `https://sslvpn.ethz.ch`
	- username: `<username>@student-net.ethz.ch`
	- password: your network password (also called Radius password, see: https://www.password.ethz.ch/)

Then ssh into the tik42 or j2tik login node and use your default password (also called LDAPS/AD password).

```bash
ssh <username>@tik42x.ethz.ch
```

Once you're in you'll have access to:

- Compute: The login node is only for file management and job submission. Do not run any computation on the login node.
- Storage: Use `/scratch/$USER` on the compute-nodes for temporary storage. Try to avoid using `/itet-stor/$USER/net_scratch/cluster` on the login-node.

Keep in mind:

- to use >8 GPUs you need your supervisor's permission and must reserve the nodes in advance in the shared calendar
- only submit jobs to `arton[01-08]`
- the A100s with 80GB on `tikgpu10` need special privileges
- the A6000s with 48GB on `tikgpu08` need special privileges
- set friendly `nice` values to your jobs, keep them small and preferably as array jobs

## 1.2. Running SLURM jobs

Before running a demo job, let's first add the following aliases to your `~/.bashrc.$USER`. Don't forget to run `source ~/.bashrc.$USER` afterwards:

```bash
# convenience commands for slurm
export SLURM_CONF=/home/sladmitet/slurm/slurm.conf
alias smon_free="grep --color=always --extended-regexp 'free|$' /home/sladmitet/smon.txt"
alias smon_mine="grep --color=always --extended-regexp '${USER}|$' /home/sladmitet/smon.txt"
alias watch_smon_free="watch --interval 300 --no-title --differences --color \"grep --color=always --extended-regexp 'free|$' /home/sladmitet/smon.txt\""
alias watch_smon_mine="watch --interval 300 --no-title --differences --color \"grep --color=always --extended-regexp '${USER}|$' /home/sladmitet/smon.txt\""
```

Next we will run our little MNIST example written with Pytorch:

```bash
# clone this repository
cd /itet-stor/$USER/net_scratch/cluster
git clone https://github.com/ETH-DISCO/cluster-tutorial/
mv ./cluster-tutorial .

# install conda
./conda_install.sh

# replace the placeholders with your actual username
sed 's/{{USERNAME}}/$USER/g' job.sh > job.sh
sed 's/{{USERNAME}}/$USER/g' job_array.sh > job_array.sh

# create job environment, dispatch job
conda env create -f conda-environment.yml
sbatch job.sh
sbatch job_array.sh

# check progress
watch -n 1 "squeue | grep $USER"
```

Once you're done you can check the output in `/itet-stor/{{USERNAME}}/net_scratch/cluster/jobs/`. Each filepointer your script writes to (ie. stderr, stdout) will have its own file.

## 1.3. Debugging and Prototyping

By running Slurm scripts you won't see the logs in real-time which can slow you down during development. For debugging or prototyping purposes it might make sense to attach your terminal to individual compute nodes and then 

```bash
# check node availability
smon_free
squeue --Format=jobarrayid:9,state:10,partition:14,reasonlist:16,username:10,tres-alloc:47,timeused:11,command:140,nodelist:20

# attach to a tikgpu06 node assuming it's free
srun --mem=250GB --gres=gpu:01 --nodelist tikgpu06 --pty bash -i

# set up storage
mkdir -p /scratch/$USER
cd /scratch/$USER

# deploy notebook
conda create --name jupyternb notebook --channel conda-forge
conda activate jupyternb
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 5998 --ip $(hostname -f) # port range [5900-5999]
```

The last instruction will display a public link that you can then use to access the notebook.

Make sure to deactivate the conda environment after you're done:

```bash
conda deactivate
conda env list
conda remove --all --yes --name jupyternb
exit # back to login node
```

# 2. Using Apptainer

The workflow introduced in the previous section with Conda is painfully slow in practice.

I’m uncertain if this is correct since the machines in our cluster have high network bandwidth, ample storage and plenty of compute power. But I believe that NFS4 might be sensitive to handling a large number of files, like those generated by Conda. This could explain why some file-related commands take up to an hour to run, while heavy computational tasks using CPU/GPU resources complete quickly.

Fortunately, our admins provide Apptainer, a containerization tool similar to Docker but designed for HPC environments. I recommend using Apptainer over Conda.

Here's how:

```bash
# check node availability
smon_free
squeue --Format=jobarrayid:9,state:10,partition:14,reasonlist:16,username:10,tres-alloc:47,timeused:11,command:140,nodelist:20

# attach to a tikgpu06 node assuming it's free
srun --mem=250GB --gres=gpu:01 --nodelist tikgpu06 --pty bash -i

# set up storage (filesystem should be ext4, so a lot faster)
mkdir -p /scratch/$USER
cd /scratch/$USER

# run cuda pytorch from jupyter notebook
apptainer build --sandbox pytorch_sandbox docker://pytorch/pytorch:latest
apptainer shell --nv pytorch_sandbox
```

Fallback: If you're on a tight schedule and things aren't working out, you can always fall back to cloud GPU providers. The best free option is Google Colab with a Tesla T4 and 12 hours of runtime per session (as of August 2024). Other options include:

- https://cloud-gpus.com/
- https://getdeploying.com/reference/cloud-gpu
